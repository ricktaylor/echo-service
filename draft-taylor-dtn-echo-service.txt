Abstract

   This document specifies an echo service for Bundle Protocol Version 7
   (BPv7) networks.  The echo service receives bundles at a well-known
   endpoint and reflects them back to the originator, making only the
   minimal changes necessary to route the response.  This enables round-
   trip time measurement and end-to-end connectivity verification in
   Delay-Tolerant Networks.  This document requests IANA allocation of a
   well-known IPN service number and DTN demux for the echo service.

1.  Introduction

   Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs) present unique challenges for network
   diagnostics.  Unlike traditional IP networks where ICMP Echo (ping)
   provides immediate feedback, DTN bundles might traverse store-and-
   forward paths with significant delays.  Nevertheless, the ability to
   verify end-to-end connectivity and measure round-trip time remains
   essential for network operators.

   This document specifies an echo service for Bundle Protocol Version 7
   [RFC9171].  The service operates as a simple reflector: it receives
   bundles addressed to its well-known endpoint and returns them to the
   originator, making only the minimal changes necessary to route the
   response.

   Conceptually, the echo service acts as a loopback within the node.
   Upon receiving a bundle, it clones the bundle and swaps source and
   destination endpoint identifiers, then submits this response bundle
   to the local BPA for transmission.  The BPA processes the response
   bundle as it would any outbound bundle, applying standard extension
   block handling, routing, and forwarding.  This design means the echo
   service itself performs minimal processing, delegating most bundle
   handling to the BPA.

   The echo service is intentionally simple: it performs only bundle
   reflection with no payload interpretation or special processing.
   This simplicity ensures maximum interoperability, as any conformant
   echo service will behave identically regardless of implementation.  A
   standardized echo service enables the development of diagnostic tools
   such as ping clients that can operate across heterogeneous DTN
   deployments.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses terminology from the Bundle Protocol Version 7
   specification [RFC9171].

   Echo Service:  A Bundle Protocol service that reflects received
      bundles back to their originator.

   Reflection:  The process of creating a response bundle by swapping
      source and destination, preserving all other bundle content to the
      extent possible.  The echo service makes only the minimum changes
      necessary to route the bundle back to the originator.

3.  Echo Service Specification

3.1.  Service Endpoint

   An echo service MUST register to receive bundles at a well-known
   endpoint identifier.  Two endpoint schemes are defined:

   IPN Scheme:  Service number 128 on any node.  For example, ipn:2.128
      represents the echo service on node number 2.  Implementations MAY
      also support service number 7 for backwards compatibility with
      existing deployments; service number 7 is in the Private Use range
      per [RFC9758] and cannot be reserved.

   DTN Scheme:  The demux echo on any node.  For example,
      dtn://example.dtn/echo represents the echo service on the node
      with node-name example.dtn.

   An implementation MAY support additional endpoints beyond these well-
   known values, but MUST support at least one of the well-known
   endpoints defined above.

3.2.  Bundle Processing

   The echo service operates conceptually as a loopback: upon receiving
   a bundle, it clones the bundle with source and destination swapped,
   then submits the response bundle to the local BPA for transmission.
   The BPA then processes the response bundle as it would any outbound
   bundle, applying standard extension block handling, routing, and
   forwarding.

   This model means the echo service itself performs minimal processing
   - it modifies the primary block and preserves the payload, then
   delegates all other bundle processing to the BPA.  The block-specific
   behavior described below reflects this division of responsibility.

   The echo service MUST NOT generate bundles other than reflections of
   received bundles.  Other services at the node SHOULD NOT generate
   bundles using the echo service endpoint as source.

3.2.1.  Primary Block

   The echo service modifies the primary block to route the response
   back to the originator.  Since the primary block is modified, its CRC
   MUST be recalculated before transmission.  The CRC type MUST NOT be
   changed.

   The following specifies the handling of each primary block field:

   Source and Destination:  The echo service MUST set the destination to
      the received bundle's source, and MUST set the source to the echo
      service's endpoint (the received bundle's destination).

   Creation Timestamp and Lifetime:  The echo service MUST preserve the
      creation timestamp and lifetime unchanged.  Preserving these
      fields allows the originating client to control the maximum round-
      trip time for the bundle.

   Bundle Processing Control Flags:  The echo service MUST preserve the
      bundle processing control flags unchanged.

   Report-to EID:  The echo service MUST preserve the report-to EID
      unchanged.  If the original sender requested status reports, this
      ensures reports about the response bundle are delivered to the
      same endpoint.

   Note: When the creation timestamp is preserved, a theoretical
   collision is possible if two bundles from different originators
   arrive with identical creation timestamps.  Both reflections would
   have the same source and creation timestamp, making them
   indistinguishable.  This is extremely rare in practice and represents
   an acceptable trade-off; diagnostic tools that use the echo service
   are typically designed to tolerate occasional packet loss.

3.2.2.  Payload Block

   The payload block is central to the echo service's purpose: it
   carries the data that the client expects to receive back unchanged.
   The echo service MUST preserve the payload block exactly as received.
   This preservation allows clients to verify round-trip integrity by
   comparing the reflected payload against what was originally sent.

3.2.3.  Extension Blocks

   The echo service preserves extension blocks in the cloned bundle,
   retaining each block's block type code, block processing control
   flags, CRC type, and block-type-specific data.  Block numbers SHOULD
   NOT be changed, as other blocks (such as BPSec blocks) may reference
   them.  CRCs MUST be recalculated for blocks whose content changes
   during BPA processing.

   Since the echo service submits the response bundle to the BPA for
   transmission, the BPA applies standard [RFC9171] extension block
   processing, updating blocks as appropriate for an outbound bundle.

   For unrecognized blocks, the BPA applies block processing control
   flags per [RFC9171], Section 4.2.4, respecting the "Delete bundle if
   block can't be processed" flag (bit 2) and discarding unrecognized
   blocks that lack this flag.

   The following subsections describe the expected behavior for commonly
   used extension blocks.

3.2.3.1.  Hop Count Block

   If the received bundle contains a Hop Count Block (block type 10),
   the echo service preserves it in the response bundle.  When the BPA
   processes the outbound response bundle, it increments the hop count
   as specified in [RFC9171].  If the hop count exceeds the hop limit,
   the BPA will delete the bundle rather than forward it.  Clients need
   to set hop limits with this additional increment in mind.

3.2.3.2.  Previous Node Block

   If the received bundle contains a Previous Node Block (block type 6),
   the echo service preserves it; the BPA updates it during normal
   forwarding processing.

3.2.3.3.  Bundle Age Block

   If the received bundle contains a Bundle Age Block (block type 7),
   the echo service SHOULD preserve it unchanged.  The BPA updates the
   bundle age during normal forwarding processing.

3.2.3.4.  Other Extension Blocks

   For any other extension blocks, the echo service preserves them in
   the cloned bundle, and the BPA applies standard block processing.

3.2.4.  Status Reports

   When the received bundle has status report request flags set, the
   echo service node generates multiple status reports for the bundle's
   journey:

   1.  *Received*: Generated when the BPA receives the bundle at the
       echo service node

   2.  *Delivered*: Generated when the BPA delivers the bundle to the
       echo service

   These reports are sent to the report-to endpoint specified in the
   original bundle and describe the original bundle's arrival at its
   destination.

   The response bundle, having preserved the status report request
   flags, will generate its own separate status reports:

   1.  *Forwarded*: Generated when the BPA forwards the response bundle
       from the echo service node

   2.  *Received* and *Forwarded*: Generated at each intermediate node
       on the return path

   3.  *Delivered*: Generated when the response bundle reaches the
       originating client

   Since the response bundle also preserves the report-to endpoint
   (Section 3.2.1), these reports are sent to the same destination.
   Clients can distinguish original bundle reports from response bundle
   reports by examining the bundle identifier in each status report.

   Note: Status reporting is optional per [RFC9171] and many BPA
   implementations disable it by default.  Clients cannot rely on
   receiving status reports for correct operation.

3.2.5.  Security Blocks

   BIB and BCB blocks as defined in [RFC9172] require no special
   handling; they are processed as extension blocks per Section 3.2.3.

3.3.  Client Considerations

   While the echo service specification focuses primarily on the
   reflector, certain requirements apply to clients to ensure correct
   operation.  This section defines those normative requirements.

3.3.1.  Session Disambiguation

   When multiple clients run concurrently on the same node, each session
   must be distinguishable so that responses are delivered to the
   correct client.  Multiple concurrent clients on the same node MUST
   use distinct source endpoint identifiers.  Per [RFC9171], each
   application instance registers with a unique endpoint ID, and the
   combination of source and destination provides session disambiguation
   at the bundle layer without requiring any session identifier in the
   payload.

3.3.2.  Bundle Integrity

   Clients that wish to sign bundles for integrity verification must
   account for the fact that the echo service modifies the primary block
   during reflection.  If a client signs bundles with a BIB whose
   Integrity-Protected Plaintext (IPPT) includes the primary block
   (integrity scope flags bit 0 set per [RFC9173]), the signature will
   be computed over the original primary block contents.  When the echo
   service swaps the source and destination, the primary block changes,
   and verification of such a BIB will fail.

   To ensure that integrity verification succeeds on the reflected
   bundle, clients that sign bundles SHOULD clear the "include primary
   block" flag (bit 0) in their integrity scope flags.  With this flag
   cleared, the BIB signature covers only the payload and optionally the
   security headers, all of which remain unchanged through reflection.

3.3.3.  Fragmentation

   Diagnostic clients SHOULD set the "bundle must not be fragmented"
   flag in bundles sent to the echo service.  Fragmentation complicates
   round-trip time measurement and payload verification: fragments might
   take different paths, arrive out of order, or be lost independently.
   Setting this flag ensures the bundle either traverses the network
   intact or is dropped, providing cleaner diagnostic results.

   If a client needs to test path MTU, it can send bundles of increasing
   size with fragmentation disabled and observe which sizes succeed.
   This approach directly reveals the path's maximum bundle size rather
   than relying on fragmentation behavior.

4.  Security Considerations

   This section discusses security issues relevant to the echo service
   and potential mitigations.

4.1.  Amplification Attacks

   Like any echo or reflection service, the Bundle Protocol echo service
   could potentially be used for amplification attacks if the response
   bundle is larger than the request.  This might occur if the echo
   service adds extension blocks to the response.  To mitigate this
   risk, implementations SHOULD:

   *  Rate-limit echo responses, particularly from previously unseen
      source endpoints

   *  Monitor for unusual traffic patterns that might indicate abuse

   *  Consider requiring authentication via Bundle Protocol Security
      [RFC9172] in sensitive deployments

   In practice, the amplification potential is limited because the echo
   service preserves the payload unchanged and is expected to make
   minimal modifications to the bundle.  Any amplification would come
   only from small differences in bundle overhead.

4.2.  Information Disclosure

   Echo responses inherently confirm the existence and reachability of
   the echo service endpoint.  Additionally, round-trip time
   measurements might reveal information about network topology, path
   characteristics, and store-and-forward delays that could be useful to
   an adversary mapping a network.

   In sensitive environments where this information disclosure is a
   concern, operators MAY:

   *  Restrict echo service access to authenticated endpoints using
      BPSec

   *  Disable the echo service entirely on nodes where diagnostics are
      not required

   *  Deploy the echo service only on designated diagnostic nodes rather
      than throughout the network

4.3.  Resource Exhaustion

   An attacker could attempt to exhaust echo service resources by
   sending a large volume of bundles or bundles with very large
   payloads.  Since the echo service must clone and retransmit each
   received bundle, this creates both memory and bandwidth pressure.
   Implementations SHOULD:

   *  Limit the maximum payload size accepted for reflection

   *  Implement rate limiting on both connections and bundle processing

   *  Monitor resource usage and reject or delay bundle processing when
      under stress

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Well-Known Service Registration

   This document requests IANA to extend the "'ipn' Scheme URI Well-
   Known Service Numbers for BPv7" registry established by [RFC9758] to
   include a "DTN Demux" column, and to register the following entry:

   +=======+===========+==============+=================+
   | Value | DTN Demux | Description  | Reference       |
   +=======+===========+==============+=================+
   | 128   | echo      | Echo Service | (this document) |
   +-------+-----------+--------------+-----------------+

             Table 1: Echo Service Registration

   The IPN service number and DTN demux together define a well-known
   Bundle Protocol service.  For the IPN scheme, the service number is
   appended to the node number (e.g., ipn:2.128).  For the DTN scheme,
   the demux is appended to the node-name to form the demux component of
   the URI (e.g., dtn://example.dtn/echo).

   Note: The IPN value 7 has been used by convention in existing
   implementations, mirroring the well-known UDP port for the Echo
   Protocol [RFC862].  However, service numbers 1-127 are designated
   Private Use per [RFC9758].  This document requests service number
   128, the lowest value in the Standards Action range.  Implementations
   MAY continue to support service number 7 for backwards compatibility.

Appendix A.  Ping Client Considerations

   This appendix provides non-normative guidance for implementing ping
   clients that use the echo service.  While the echo service
   specification defines the reflector behavior, effective ping clients
   require careful attention to timing, session management, and payload
   design.

A.1.  Round-Trip Time Calculation

   Accurate round-trip time (RTT) measurement is the primary purpose of
   most ping implementations.  Ping clients should calculate RTT using
   locally stored timestamps rather than timestamps embedded in the
   payload:

   RTT = response_receive_time - request_sent_times[sequence_number]

   This approach offers several advantages:

   *  Requires no clock synchronization between nodes

   *  Works correctly even if the payload is corrupted

   *  Avoids serialization overhead in the timing path

   The client should maintain a map from sequence number to sent
   timestamp.  It should populate the map when each request is
   transmitted and consult it when each response arrives.  Entries
   should be removed after a configurable timeout to prevent unbounded
   memory growth.

A.2.  Endpoint Selection

   As required by Section 3.3.1, multiple concurrent clients on the same
   node use distinct source endpoint identifiers.

   For example, if two concurrent ping sessions on node ipn:1.0 target
   ipn:2.128, they should use distinct source endpoints such as
   ipn:1.1001 and ipn:1.1002.  The bundle protocol agent will then route
   responses back to the correct session based on the destination in the
   reflected bundle.

A.3.  Payload Format

   Since the echo service preserves bundle content unchanged except for
   the source and destination swap, the payload format is entirely at
   the discretion of the ping client.  The echo service does not parse
   or interpret the payload, so implementations may use any encoding
   that suits their needs.

   At minimum, the payload need only contain a sequence number so that
   the client can match responses to their corresponding requests.  For
   implementations seeking extensibility and interoperability, a CBOR-
   based format is suggested:

   [
     sequence,     ; uint: monotonically increasing counter
     options       ; map: optional fields (may be empty)
   ]

                 Figure 1: Suggested Payload Format (CBOR)

   The options map provides room for future extensions and may include:

   +=====+===========+============================================+
   | Key | Name      | Description                                |
   +=====+===========+============================================+
   | 0   | Padding   | Padding bytes for path MTU testing; allows |
   |     |           | clients to test whether bundles of various |
   |     |           | sizes can traverse the network             |
   +-----+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | 1   | Timestamp | DTN time ([RFC9171], Section 4.2.6), i.e., |
   |     |           | milliseconds since the DTN Epoch, for      |
   |     |           | debugging purposes; while not used for RTT |
   |     |           | calculation (see Appendix A.1), this can   |
   |     |           | help diagnose clock synchronization issues |
   +-----+-----------+--------------------------------------------+
   | 2   | Extension | List of attached extension block types;    |
   |     | Blocks    | enables clients to verify which extension  |
   |     |           | blocks survive the round trip              |
   +-----+-----------+--------------------------------------------+

                  Table 2: Suggested Payload Options

A.4.  Statistics

   Ping clients should track and report standard statistics consistent
   with traditional IP ping:

   *  Bundles transmitted

   *  Responses received

   *  Packet loss percentage

   *  RTT minimum, average, maximum, and standard deviation

   These statistics provide a quick assessment of network health and
   help identify routing problems, congestion, or intermittent
   connectivity.

   Example output format following ICMP ping conventions:

   --- ipn:2.128 ping statistics ---
   5 bundles transmitted, 4 received, 20% loss
   rtt min/avg/max/stddev = 1.234/2.567/4.891/1.203 s
